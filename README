Life has been kind to you. You have your own backyard, the mice are plentiful,
and sometimes, if you are lucky, you catch a rabbit. A pink, fluffy rabbit. A
very tasty, pink, fluffly rabbit.

...Until one day. When the pesky, nasty, bipedal humans saw you in your yard and
they tried to stop you.

Will you manage to ESCAPE THE BACKYARD?
